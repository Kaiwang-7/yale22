# Summer Research at Yale (2022)

This repository contains code and images from my summer internship at Yale.

## Project Overview

Using Single-cell RNA-seq data from the T-cells of cancer patients receiving CAR-T therapy, the goal of this project is to determine differentiating genes 
between Remission and No-response patients.

## Details

- **Language Used:** R
- **Data Source:** Single-cell RNA-seq data from the worldâ€™s first clinical trial of CAR-T therapy.

## Project Goals

- Using data from a groundbreaking cancer treatment that involves genetically engineering immune cells to target blood cancer.
- Organize, clean, analyze, and plot data gathered from the clinical trial.
- Identify differentiating genes between patients who went into remission and those who did not respond to the therapy.

## Visualizations

Here is a link to an overview of the visualizations created from the data:
